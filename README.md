# pants-getting-started

Getting started with [Pants Build](https://pantsbuild.github.io/) isn't [easy](https://pantsbuild.github.io/install.html):

> As of September 2014, alas, Pants is not something you can just install and use. To be precise: you can install it, but unless you've also [Set up your code workspace to work with Pants](https://pantsbuild.github.io/setup_repo.html), it won't work. You can use it in a workspace in which some Pants expert has set it up.

So that's what I did â€“ used existing pants setups to figure out the minimal Scala/Java project structure to get a Pants project compiling and running tests (including running tests written with JUnit, ScalaTest and Specs2).

## Install

All you need to do to get started is [install](https://pantsbuild.github.io/install.html) the Pants executable ([System-wide Installation](https://pantsbuild.github.io/install.html#system-wide-installation) using `pip` works great for me):

```bash
$ sudo pip install pantsbuild.pants
```

Alternatively you can run the script `./build-support/scripts/setup` which also installs Java and Scala (in addition to Pants).

## Run Build

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:orrsella/pants-getting-started.git
$ cd pants-getting-started/
$ pants test example:
```

(tested with Pants version 0.0.36)
